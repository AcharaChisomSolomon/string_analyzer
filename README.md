String Analyzer API
This is a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js that analyzes strings, computes their properties, and stores them in an in-memory data store. The API supports creating, retrieving, filtering, and deleting string entries based on the specified endpoints.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

Node.js (version 14 or higher recommended)

Installation

Create a new directory for the project:
mkdir string-analyzer-api
cd string-analyzer-api


Initialize a new Node.js project:
npm init -y


Install dependencies:
npm install express


Create a file named index.js and copy the provided API code into it.

Run the server:
node index.js

The server will start listening on port 3000. You can access the API at http://localhost:3000.


Dependencies

express: Web framework for building the API. Install via npm install express.
crypto: Built-in Node.js module for computing SHA-256 hashes (no installation required).

No other external dependencies are needed.
Environment Variables
No environment variables are required for this application. The port is hardcoded to 3000 but can be modified in the code if needed.
API Documentation
1. Create/Analyze String

Method: POST
Endpoint: /strings
Content-Type: application/json
Request Body:{
  "value": "string to analyze"
}


Success Response (201 Created):{
  "id": "sha256_hash_value",
  "value": "string to analyze",
  "properties": {
    "length": 17,
    "is_palindrome": false,
    "unique_characters": 12,
    "word_count": 3,
    "sha256_hash": "abc123...",
    "character_frequency_map": {
      "s": 2,
      "t": 3,
      "r": 2
    }
  },
  "created_at": "2025-08-27T10:00:00Z"
}


Error Responses:
409 Conflict: String already exists
400 Bad Request: Invalid or missing "value"
422 Unprocessable Entity: Invalid data type for "value"



2. Get Specific String

Method: GET
Endpoint: /strings/{string_value}
Success Response (200 OK): Same structure as create response
Error Responses:
404 Not Found: String does not exist



Note: {string_value} should be URL-encoded if it contains special characters (e.g., spaces).
3. Get All Strings with Filtering

Method: GET
Endpoint: /strings?is_palindrome=true&min_length=5&max_length=20&word_count=2&contains_character=a
Query Parameters:
is_palindrome: boolean (true/false)
min_length: integer
max_length: integer
word_count: integer
contains_character: single character


Success Response (200 OK):{
  "data": [ /* array of string objects */ ],
  "count": 15,
  "filters_applied": { /* applied filters */ }
}


Error Responses:
400 Bad Request: Invalid parameters



4. Natural Language Filtering

Method: GET
Endpoint: /strings/filter-by-natural-language?query=all%20single%20word%20palindromic%20strings
Success Response (200 OK):{
  "data": [ /* array of string objects */ ],
  "count": 3,
  "interpreted_query": {
    "original": "all single word palindromic strings",
    "parsed_filters": { /* parsed filters */ }
  }
}


Supported Queries:
"all single word palindromic strings" → word_count=1, is_palindrome=true
"strings longer than 10 characters" → min_length=11
"strings shorter than 5 characters" → max_length=4
"palindromic strings that contain the first vowel" → is_palindrome=true, contains_character=a
"strings containing the letter z" → contains_character=z
"all palindromic strings" → is_palindrome=true
"strings with exactly 3 words" → word_count=3
"strings between 5 and 10 characters" → min_length=5, max_length=10
"strings that contain 'e' and are palindromes" → contains_character=e, is_palindrome=true


Error Responses:
400 Bad Request: Unable to parse query
422 Unprocessable Entity: Conflicting filters (e.g., min_length > max_length)



5. Delete String

Method: DELETE
Endpoint: /strings/{string_value}
Success Response (204 No Content): Empty body
Error Responses:
404 Not Found: String does not exist



Tests
No automated tests are included in this implementation. You can test the API using tools like Postman or curl.
Example curl for POST:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/strings -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"value": "hello world"}'

Notes

Storage: Data is stored in-memory using a Map. All data is lost on server restart. For production, consider integrating a database like MongoDB.
Hashing: SHA-256 is used for unique IDs. Collisions are theoretically possible but extremely unlikely.
Natural Language Parsing: Limited to keyword matching for the specified examples. The parsing logic is now encapsulated in the parseNaturalLanguageQuery function for better modularity. Expand this function for more complex queries.
Edge Cases: Handles empty strings (length 0, word_count 0). Palindrome check is case-insensitive.
Security: No authentication implemented. Add JWT or similar for production use.
Path Parameters: For strings with spaces or special chars, URL-encode them (e.g., "hello world" becomes "hello%20world").
